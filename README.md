## The project

The bartap project is a SaaS solution for the catering branch. It provides a mobile application for stock keeping, customer management and bill administration. This project can be found [here](https://github.com/tungstun-ict/bartap-app). All data is processed and stored in a Spring Boot microservice backend. This is the documentation for the backend!

## Micro services

The project is divided in multiple different services connected via the [Kafka message bus](docs/kafka/overview.md).

### [Product service](broken-reference)

This service is responsible for storing the products of every bar.
