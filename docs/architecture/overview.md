# Overview

Every project needs architecture. Especially when the project is distributed in micro-services the use of a predefined set of rules / guidelines is highly recommended. For this project we use the domain driven design method to add order to the chaos of adding functionallity to an isolated domain. Every micro-service uses hexagonal architecture to structure its code.
